<h1>About</h1>
<br/>
<p>I was born July 4, 2001 in California. I was raised in San Mateo for most my youth. My family moved in 2008
            because of the banking crisis, I learned this later. We moved to Washington State, Kennewick. There I spent
            most my teen years, going back and forth between Washington and California. In 2013-15 we moved back, I
            donâ€™t remember the exact year. I have ben living in Richmond for six years now. I like to play video games
            often. I tend to read in my past time. I love to draw and write stories for myself.</p>
